 * afppass.h - AUFS Distributed Password defines.
 *
 * User passwords are normally stored in ~user/.afppass in DES encrypted
 * form. This file also contains values for password expiry date, minimum
 * password length, maximum failed login attempts and number of failed
 * login attempts.
 *
 * For greater security, the file must be owned by the user and be set to
 * mode AFP_DISTPW_MODE (usually 0600 or -rw-------), if this is not the
 * case, the file is deleted.
 *
 * The decryption key is stored in a global afppass (defaults to the
 * file /usr/local/lib/cap/afppass) which also contains default values
 * for expiry date, minimum password length and maximum failed attempts.
 * If this file is not owned by root and mode 0600 it will be removed.
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1. In the case of user home directories mounted via NFS, the files must
 * be set to mode 0644 (since root cannot read mode 0600 files on remote
 * filesystems). You can change the mode using the define
 * -DAFP_DISTPW_MODE=0644
 * 
 * 2. If you prefer to keep the .afppass files centrally, you can define
 * the path using the define -DAFP_DISTPW_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib/cap/upw\"
 *
 * 3. The decryption key for the global afppass is defined by AFP_DIST_PASS
 * Should be localized for each site, using -DAFP_DIST_PASS=\"password\".
 *
 * 4. AFP passwords can only be changed by the user with the AppleShare
 * workstation client or by the UNIX superuser using aufsmkusr.
 *
 * 5. User AFP passwords MUST NOT be identical to UNIX login passwords,
 * this restriction is enforced by the library routines.
