/*
 * fcntldomv.h - Definitions for hidden fcntl calls in HP/Apollo Domain BSD 4.3.
 *
 * The F_SETLK and F_GETLK fcntl calls are not documented for HP/Apollo Domain
 * BSD 4.3 environment, but apparently exist and work.  Below are the 
 * necessary definitions as defined in the SysV environment.  
 *
 * These lock calls are only needed if the APPLICATION_MANAGER and/or 
 * DENYREADWRITE options are enabled in m4.features.  The APPLICATION_MANAGER's
 * features (inihibiting finder copying and limiting the number of simultaneous
 * executions of applications) appear to work with these hidden calls.
 * Interestingly enough, these features appear to work even when the managed
 * applications reside on another node's disk, even though the Domain Sys V
 * documentation for fcntl says that record locking works only on the
 * station local to the call.
